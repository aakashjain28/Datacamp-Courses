Your goal will be to predict their party affiliation ('Democrat' or 'Republican') based on how they voted on certain key issues. Here, it's worth noting that we have preprocessed this dataset to deal with missing values. This is so that your focus can be directed towards understanding how to train and evaluate supervised learning models. Once you have mastered these fundamentals, you will be introduced to preprocessing techniques in Chapter 4 and have the chance to apply them there yourself - including on this very same dataset!\n",

For a refresher on the importance of EDA, check out the first two chapters of Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1).\n",

Following this with some visual EDA will give you an even better understanding of the data. In the video, Hugo used the `scatter_matrix()` function on the Iris data for this purpose. However, you may have noticed in the previous exercise that all the features in this dataset are binary; that is, they are either 0 or 1. So a different type of plot would be more useful here, such as Seaborn's `countplot`.\n",

So the resulting plot shows the difference in voting behavior between the two parties for the 'education' bill, with each party colored differently. We manually specified the color to be `'RdBu'`, as the Republican party has been traditionally associated with red, and the Democratic party with blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like Democrats voted resoundingly against this bill, compared to Republicans. This is the kind of information that our machine learning model will seek to learn when we try to predict party affiliation solely based on voting behavior. An expert in U.S politics may be able to predict this without machine learning, but probably not instantaneously - and certainly not if we are dealing with hundreds of samples!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the IPython Shell, explore the voting behavior further by generating countplots for the `'satellite'` and `'missile'` bills, and answer the following question: Of these two bills, for which ones do Democrats vote resoundingly in favor of, compared to Republicans? Be sure to begin your plotting statements for each figure with `plt.figure()` so that a new figure will be set up. Otherwise, your plots will be overlayed onto the same figure."

In the following exercises, you'll be working with the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) digits recognition dataset, which has 10 classes, the digits 0 through 9!

Helpfully for the MNIST dataset, scikit-learn provides an `'images'` key in addition to the `'data'` and `'target'` keys that you have seen with the Iris data. Because it is a 2D array of the images corresponding to each sample, this `'images'` key is useful for visualizing the images, as you'll see in this exercise (for more on plotting 2D arrays, see [Chapter 2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-python) of DataCamp's course on Data Visualization with Python). On the other hand, the 'data' key contains the feature array - that is, the images as a flattened array of 64 pixels.\n",

Notice how some features seem to have different units of measurement. `'density'`, for instance, takes values between 0.98 and 1.04, while `'total sulfur dioxide'` ranges from 9 to 440. As a result, it may be worth scaling the features here.
